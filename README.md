## Introduction
This project focuses on detecting sarcasm in airline reviews. Sarcasm detection is an essential task in natural language processing (NLP) as it helps in understanding the sentiment of the text more accurately. Airline reviews often contain sarcastic remarks that can mislead sentiment analysis models if not properly identified.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques for cleaning and preparing textual data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Methods to extract meaningful features from text.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of various machine learning models for sarcasm detection.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Tools to evaluate the performance of the models.
- **Visualization**: Visual representation of data and results.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of airline reviews collected from Data.World. Each review is labeled as either sarcastic or non-sarcastic. The dataset can be found [here]([link-to-dataset](https://data.world/khushipitroda/skyratings-unleashing-23k-airline-reviews)).

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sarcasm-detection-airline-reviews.git
    cd sarcasm-detection-airline-reviews
    ```

## Model Training
The project supports several machine learning models, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- GaussianNB

## Results
The results of the trained models, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
